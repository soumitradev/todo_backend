# ToDo++
## What?
This is the next level of my todo list web app. This time, it has a backend written in Python and powered by Flask. It is a CRUD app that uses a RESTful API. This is the code repository for the backend API. It can Create, Read, Update and Delete notes. It can store notes publicly, and you can access these notes from any device anywhere in the world. The frontend for this app is still a work in progress, and this code needs to be pushed to a server for this to work.

I'm thinking about hosting the frontend on GitHub Pages or Netlify, but I'll also have to look into where I can host the backend. I hope I can find a place for that. I might host it on GCP's free tier, but I don't know if that much storage would be enough. I'd love it if I could host it on GitHub though.

## Installation
### Requirements
Python 3 and some other flask modules. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### How can I run this API on my own machine?
Just run `python3 ./main.py` (Use python3) after installing requirements.


## Why?
I really want to learn more about connecting the frontend to the backend.

## The Code is bad
I'm trying my best. If you really hate it that bad, just create an Issue or Pull Request.
