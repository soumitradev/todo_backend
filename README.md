# ToDo++ [WIP]
## What?
This is the next level of my todo list web app. This time, it has a backend written in Python and powered by Flask. It is a CRUD app that uses a RESTful API. This is the code repository for the backend API. It can Create, Read, Update and Delete notes. This *is* a work in progress though, this is a first for me, and this is kind of a big project for me, so this might take some time.

## Installation
### Requirements
Python 3 and some other flask modules. Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### How can I run this API on my own machine?
Just run `python3 ./main.py` (Use python3) after installing requirements.


## Why?
I really want to learn more about connecting the frontend to the backend.

## The Code is bad
I'm trying my best. If you really hate it that bad, just create an Issue or Pull Request.
